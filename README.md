# Project: BeatBox

## Project Description

This project introduces one of the most fundamental computer science data structures, Linked Lists. We are introduced to Linked Lists by creating a Beatbox Machine.

### Functionality
- Insert elements
- Pop an element from the end
- Push an element onto the beginning
- Remove the (first occurrence	all occurrences) of - an element by data content
- Remove an element by position
- Add an element at an arbitrary position
-Add an element after a known node
- Find whether a data element is or is not in the list
- Find the distance between two nodes

### Things I Would Like To Improve
- Add recursion.
    - I think this would work with methods without parameters.
- Look for more edge cases.
- More consistant or descriptive parameters.
    - this is to try and not have 'data' or 'string' all over the page. Although, LinkedLists are repetitive.
- Create a helper method that will clean up code and iterate through to the last node.
